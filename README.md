# NYC 311 Service Requests Analysis

In this project, I have analyzed 311 service request data from New York City. I have used various data wrangling techniques to discover patterns in the data and visualized the primary complaint types.


## Project Steps

1. **Dataset Examination:**
   - Determined the dataset's dimensions
   - Identified variables containing null values

2. **Basic Data Exploration:**
   - Applied missing value management
   - Investigated the date column and removed entries with incorrect timelines
   - Created a frequency plot for city-based complaints
   - Produced scatter and hexbin plots to show complaint density in Brooklyn

3. **Main Complaint Categories Identification:**
   - Designed a bar chart displaying the count vs. complaint types
   - Identified the top 10 complaint types
   - Presented the complaint types for each city in a separate dataset

4. **Primary Complaint Types Visualization:**
   - Depicted the main complaint types in each city

5. **Average Response Time Assessment:**
   - Assessed the average response time for different complaint types

6. **Significant Variables Discovery:**
   - Conducted statistical analysis using p-values and chi-square values to discover significant variables
